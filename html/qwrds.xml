		<e typ="t">VOCABULARY</e>
		<e typ="p">This vocabulary is not a dictionary, but only a collection of 1000 of the commonest words in Kirundi. Words are alphabetized according to the stem. Prefixes of nouns and infinitives will be separated by a hyphen. Plurals of nouns will only be given where it is irregular or where the class of the word is not self-evident. In finding words it will be necessary to remember the rules of consonant changes which take place. For example, "indwara" will be found in the r's, not the d's; many words With p will be found under h; words with a vowel beginning and having the in- prefix may have a y or z, but will be found under the vowel. The abbreviations tr. and int. stand for transitive and intransitive verbs. Sw. means Kiswahili.
