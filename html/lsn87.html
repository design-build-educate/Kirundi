			<p>177. Urya. This demonstrative means "that" of something not too near the speaker, yet not far distant. 
				It is formed by the prefix of the verb plus -rya (except in 1st cl. sing. it is <u>u</u> instead of <u>a</u>).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>urya mugore - that woman over there</li>
			</ul>
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">	
			<p>178. Uriya. Uriya means that yonder, fairly distant, yet within sight. (There is another use, 
				not just of objects within sight, but you do not need to consider that here.) Uriya is formed as urya, 
				except that <u>i</u> is inserted after the <u>r</u>. The more distant the object, the longer 
				drawn out the <u>i</u> is. e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ur-i-i-ya musozi - that hill way over there</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now you can recognize the word "hariya" that you learned some time ago. These two demonstratives, 
				like all others, precede the noun removing the initial vowel.</p>
