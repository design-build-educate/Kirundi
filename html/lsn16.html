		<h3>LESSON 16: -ra Present Tense of Verb</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary (No new vocabulary is given in this lesson, but refresh your memory on the verbs already learned:)</p>
			<ul>
				<li>-kora - work, do fix, repair, make</li>
				<li>-rima - hoe, dig, cultivate</li>
				<li>-genda - go, walk</li>
				<li>-vuga - speak, say</li>
			</ul>
		<p>26. Conjugation of -ra present. The verb is the most complicated and the most important part of Kirundi 
			grammar. It will require much careful study. There are several ways of expressing present time, but 
			here we take up only one: the( -ra present tense. This gets its name from the fact that -ra always comes 
			between the personal prefix and the stem of the word in this tense. You have already seen a few forms 
			of it in Lesson 1 and elsewhere.Here is the conjugation:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 10px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 350px">ndakora - I work, am working</td>
				<td>turakora - we work, are working</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>urakora - you (s.) work, are working</td>
				<td>murakora - you (pl.)work, are working</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>arakora - he(she) works, is working</td>
				<td>barakora - they work, are working</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Note: Remember NR becomes ND, thus ndakora. Observe and learn these personal prefixes used here: N-, U-, A-,
			 Tu-, Mu-, Ba-. The third person prefixes given are those of the first class. Verb prefixes are given 
			 with each class. A verb must agree with its subject in class and number.</p>
		<p>27. Some rules regarding this tense:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>It is used in stating a simple fact regarding that which is happening now if no phrase or object 
					follows. Occasionally it is used even with an object or phrase. Note that when a word like cane, 
					neza, ati follows the -ra present is used.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Umugabo arakora - the man is working, or works.</li>
						<li>Umuhungu agomba umunyu - the boy wants some salt.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is used in questions and answers to questions when no object or phrase follows. 
						(You will learn another tense to use when an object follows, Lesson 25.)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Abantu bararima? - Are the people hoeing?</li>
						<li>Ego, bararima. - Yes, they are hoeing.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>It is never used in a dependent clause, when it expresses present time.</li>
				<li>
					<p>It is used to express habitual action (in present time) whether an object follows or not.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Mbeg' Abarundi bararya (eat) inyama? - Do the Barundi eat meat?</li>
						<li>Abakobga bararima. - GirIs hoe.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>In some instances, such as mentioned in Rule 1. this tense is used interchangeably with the 
					prefixless present (see Lesson 25).</li>
				<li>The -ra present may express progressive or continuous present, e.g. Arakora - he is working. 
					However, see par. 35 for the tense most commonly used for this.</li>
