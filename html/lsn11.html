		<h3>LESSON 11: Class 3 (continued)</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary</p>
			<ul>
				<li>i muhira - at home</li>
				<li>inyama - meat (usually pl.)</li>
				<li>impene - goat</li>
				<li>isuka - hoe</li>
				<li>ifi - fish</li>
				<li>ifu - flour (or, ubufu)</li>
				<li>isaho - bag, sack</li>
				<li>isahane - plate, dish (Swahili)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>17. Some third class irregularities. The last five words in this vocabulary 
			have no n in the prefix; the prefix is simply i.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>ifu (flour) - its plural, amafu, is used only of different types of flour.</li>
				<li>ifi (fish) - plural is same as singular, or sometimes amafi.</li>
				<li>isuka (hoe), isaho (sack), and isahane (plate) all form 
					their plurals with ama- in the place of i. This is the regular plural 
					of the fifth class and you will learn the proper agreements there. 
					See par. 30. But the singular is 3rd class.</li>
			</ol>
		<p>Note: Isahane is a Swahili word. From time to time a few Swahili words 
			will be given because there is no equivalent for them in Kirundi.</p>
		<p>18. Preposition i. This preposition means at, to, from. It is used almost 
			entirely with place names. e.g. i Gitega - at Gitega; i Remera - at Remera.
			 With certain places ku or mu may be used, but that must be learned 
			 by familiarity with the place. However, in general, i is used.
			This preposition is also used in the expression, i muhira - at home; and 
			with the possessive pronoun thus: i wacu - at our place, or, at home; 
			i wanyu - at your place; i wabo - at their place.</p>
		<p>In these latter expressions, in most instances the plural is used; however, 
			the singular is used in connection with the head man of the kraal. He would 
			say "i wanje". If he said "i wacu" he would mean "in our vicinity".
			In speaking of "his place" one would say "i we" (not i wiwe).</p>
