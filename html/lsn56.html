			<h3>LESSON 56: Past of -ri</h3>	
		</header>
		<section class="vocab">
			<h4>Vocabulary</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>umufundi (Sw.) - skilled workman</li>
				<li>umwonga - valley</li>
				<li>kugodoka (tse) - to quit work for the day</li>
				<li>guheza (hejeje) - to finish (tr.)</li>
				<li>kuduga (ze) - to go up (hill)</li>
				<li>kumanuka (tse) to go down (hill)</li>

			<aside>Note: The words kuduga and kumanuka may or may not be followed by umusozi. They often are.</aside>						
		</section> <!-- end of vocab section -->
		<section class="parag">
			<p>114. For the past of -ri there is no change in the suffix; it is as follows:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>nari</td>
					<td>I was</td>
					<td>twari</td>
					<td>we were</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>wari</td>
					<td>you were</td>
					<td>mwari</td>
					<td>you were</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>yari</td>
					<td>he, she was</td>
					<td>bari</td>
					<td>they were</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>There is no other past simple tense for -ri, and so this form is used whenever any 
				past time of -ri is expressed.</p>
			<p>For agreement with nouns of other classes this verb follows the regular
				rules (see par. 110).</p>
			<p>This is used in forming the continuous past, as in the continuous present (par. 35): e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>twariko turaheza ibikorwa - we were finishing the work.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that the 2nd part (turaheza) remains -ra present.</p>

		<section class="parag">
			<p>115. The negative is the same with, of course, the negative prefix: sinari, ntiwari, etc.</p>
