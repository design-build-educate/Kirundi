			<p>100. Order of adjectives.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>You have already learned that the possessive adjective must follow 1mmediately 
					the noun it modifies, no matter how many other adjectives there may be.</li>
				<li>
					<p>Also, you have learned that -ndi - other, must precede the noun it modifies.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>e.g. abandi bantu benshi - many other people.</li>
					</ul>						
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The adjective -ngaho - how many? follows all other adjectives.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>e.g. abandi bahungu banini bangahe? - how many other big boys?</li>
					</ul> 						
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>If several descriptive adjectives modify one noun the other is not important, 
						although in some localities it seems to be preferred that -inshi and -keya (-ke) 
						come after the other descriptive adjectives</p>
					<ul>
						<li>e.g. inka zacu nini nyinshi - our many big cows.</li>
					</ul> 	
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The adjective -ose - all, preferably follows other adjectives.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>e.g. ibiti vyiwe binini vyose - all his big trees.</li>
					</ul> 	
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The numeral adjectives usually follow any other descriptive adjectives, 
						though it is not absolutely essential that they do.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>e.g. abana biwe bato-bato babiri - his two little children.</li>
					</ul> 	
				</li>
