			<ul>
				<li>gucungura (ye) - to redeem</li>
				<li>kuganza (jije) - to rule, govern</li>
				<li>kugora (ye) - to trouble, be difficult, annoy</li>
				<li>guha (haye) to give, give to</li>
				<li>guhana (nnye ) - to punish</li>

			<p>116. Personal object pronouns. These are expressed by little particles inserted in
					the verb between the tense sign and the verb stem. These particles are:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>n or (m)</td>
					<td>me</td>
					<td>tu (du)</td>
					<td>us</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>ku (gu)</td>
					<td>you</td>
					<td>ba</td>
					<td>you</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>mu</td>
					<td>him, her</td>
					<td>ba</td>
					<td>them</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<ul>
				<li>e.g. Ndakubona - I see you (s.)</li> 
				<li>turamushima - we praise him</li>
				<li>Imana iduharira - God forgives us</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(For the use of gu for ku, and du for tu, remember the change-down rule in par. 21; 
				and for the use of m for n, rule in par. 14.)</p>

		<section class="parag">
			<p>117. These object pronouns are the same whether used as direct or indirect objects.
					e.g. I give you the book. is: Ndaguha igitabo, though here 'you' is an indirect
					object. As indicated in par. 103, one would not say "Ndabona wewe"  for
					"I see you". However, for special emphasis one might say "Ndakubona wewe" - I
					see you, you there!</p>
			<p>Note: The k or t of an object pronoun changes according to the change-down rule, 
				but the k or t of a preceding syllable is not changed by the object pronoun.
				Thus: ndagusaba, kukubona.</p>
			<p>118. Kugora. This is often used with the impersonal prefixes: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Biragoye - it is difficult</li>
				<li>Vyamugoye - it was difficult for him</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(for tense see par. 130)</p>	
			<aside>Note 1: Observe the imperative of guha -"give me" is "mpa". The stem is only ha, of which 
				the h changes to p because of the preceding m.</aside>
			<aside>Note 2: The suffix -nnye (-hannye) is pronounced rather like n + ng (as in ring) + ye. 
				Work on this sound with an African.</aside>
