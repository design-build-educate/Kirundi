		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
		<p>As you begin your study of Kirundi there are several things that should be called to your attention. The first is that it will require serious study and application and a willingness to work hard. Never be content with the mediocre. There are those who talk about learning enough Kirundi to "get by". But you will not succeed in your relationships with the Africans as long as that is your aim. And many times the one who thinks he is "getting by;!" is often misunderstood by the Africans and also he fails to understand them correctly. Aim to speak as much like the Africans as possible, and never be satisfied with your achievements. There is always room for improvement. Be willing to let others show you your mistakes. Often in this way you will learn things that you might never have noticed for yourself.
		</p>
		<p>Kirundi is a rich language with many words having similar meanings, yet fine shades of thought. Two words may be translated by the same English word and yet they may not be used interchangeably. So strive to ferret out the exact meaning of words. Also, it is important to remember that each Kirundi word does not have an exact English equivalent, and likewise, do not expect to find a Kirundi equivalent for every English word. You have heard about ''thinking black', Africans do not think in the same terms and expressions as we do. The more you learn to think in Kirundi and express yourself as they do the more your speech will resemble theirs and the better you will be understood. Some people never get over trying to translate literally into Kirundi our English expressions.
		</p>
		<p>Develop a keen ear. Listen carefully even when you do not understand what is being said. Learn your pronunciationu>from an African, not a European</u>. Most Europeans have certain peculiarities of pronunciation, so it isu>most</u> important to copy the Africans' pronunciation. It is well during the first year to spend time every day reading and talking with an African. You may know the grammar perfectly, but if your pronunciation is bad or your expressions are too 'English' you will not be understood. Kirundi is a tonal language, which means that variations of pitch of Voice, as well as length of syllables, will completely change the meaning. Not much is indicated in these lessons about tones of individual words, except in a few cases. But all vocabulary and exercises should be practiced with an African, with particular attention being given to tone. It is well to develop some system of your own of marking the tones of words.
		</p>
		<p>Now here are a few suggestions on pronuncion:</p>
		<p>A. The Vowels:</u></p>
		<ol>
			<li>a - is broad as in far</li>
			<li>e - is almost like a in hay</li>
			<li>i - is almost like ee in bee</li>
			<li>o - is almost like the o in obey</li>
			<li>u - is like oo in food</li>
		</ol>
		<p>(These vowels have a slightly different quality than our English vowels but you will learn that as you listen carefully.)
		</p>
		<p>A. The Consonants:</u></p>
		<ul>
			<li>d, f, g, h, k, m, n, p, s, t, v, w, y are pronounced practically the same as in English.</li>
			<li>b - has a very soft sound with the lips barely touching, unless it is preceded by m when it is quite hard. It does not have the rather explosive quality that it has in English.</li>
			<li>c - always has the sound of ch as in church.</li>
			<li>j - is almost like j in just. You will hear some who give it a very soft sound like zh, but they are definitely in the minority.</li>
			<li>l - does not exist in Kirundi except in words of foreign origin, like ishuli- school, from German</li>
			<li>r - has a little trill sound, as if you tried to say d, l, and r at the same time. The tongue should just flip against the roof of the mouth.</li>
			<li>z - in most instances has a slight d sound before it, except when it is preceded by n. Again you will hear some Africans who make it soft without the d sound; but to every one who says it softly you will find about four or five who make it hard.</li>
			<li>bg - be careful not to put a vowel sound between these two letters.</li>
			<li>bw - this is not written this way in Protestant literature, but in Catholic publications you will see it. It is pronounced just like bg.</li>
			<li>nn - when a double n occurs in a past stem it is pronounced rather as if there were a slight i after the n's. It has been described as n + ng (as in sing). This is a difficult sound which will require much practice. A double n anywhere else is pronounced just like n.</li>
			<li>rw - is pronounced as if there were a soft g between the r and w.</li>
			<li>ry - has a very slight g sound between the r and y but do not make it very strong.</li>
			<li>rty - this sound cannot be described. It must be learned from an African.</li>
			<li>sw or sy - there is a slight k sound between the two letters.</li>
			<li>q or x - do not exist in Kirundi.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>These lessons have been prepared in view to a person's spending a day on each lesson. Some lessons may require more than a day's study. Do not feel when you have finished them that you have "arrived" and need no further study. This much should be known at the end of one year. But there is a great deal that is not even touched on here. Even though you may become busy in your work, do not allow yourself to become too busy to go on with your language study. It is far more important than many other things you might do.</p>
		<p>Kirundi varies from one locality to another. Certain words and forms are much more common in some areas than in others, or may have a different meaning than elsewhere. Find what is best where you are and learn that. But beware of saying that a word is not used until you have investigated carefully. Often you do not notice some particular word or expression until it has been called to your attention, and then you will hear it frequently.</p>
		<p>These lessons are only a guide to study. It is to be hoped you will learn many words in your first year that are not included here. Here are some expressions you'll want to know first:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Bgakeye (Bgakeye neza) - Good morning. (The greeting used the first time you see a person during 
				the day.)</li>
			<li>Ndagize bgakeye (Ndaguhaye bgakeye) - Good morning. (to a superior)</li>
			<li>Mwiriwe (Mwiriwe neza) - Good afternoon (evening). (Used any time during the day or evening when 
				greeting one after first time.)</li>
			<li>N'amaki - What's the news? (Usually used in place of our "How are you?")</li>
			<li>N'amahoro? -Is it peace? (Or, Is all well?)</li>
			<li>N'amahoro.  - It's good news.</li>
			<li>N'amarembe. It's peace. (or, All is well.)</li>
			<li>N'ameza. - It's good news.</li>
			<li>N'amabi. - It's bad news.</li>
			<li>Uragumye? - Are you well?   Ndagumye. - I'm well.</li>   
			<li>Urakomeye? - Are you well?  Ndakomeye. _ I'm well.</li>  
			<li>N'akagaruka. Good-bye (see you soon).</li>
			<li>N'agasaga. - Good-bye.</li>
		</ul>
