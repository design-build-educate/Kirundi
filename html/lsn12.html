		<h3>LESSON 12: Verb -ri</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ingoma - drum, throne</li>
				<li>imbuto - seed, fruit, plant</li>
				<li>intama - sheep</li>
				<li>imvunja -jigger</li>
				<li>hari - there is, there are</li>
				<li>hehe? (or he?) - where? (only used in questions)</li>
				<li>hano - here</li>
				<li>har&#299;ya - over there</li>
			</ul>
		<p>19. Verb -ri. In par. 4 we learned that ni and si are used for is, are, and the 
			negative of these words, but that in certain circumstances these words cannot 
			be used. In many instances (in fact, wherever possible) -ri is used where ni
			and si cannot be, such as with words of place but not for state of being 
			(3rd pers.) except independent clauses.</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 20px">
			<thead>Here is the present conjugation of -ri:</thead>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 250px">ndi - I am (n + ri = ndi)</td>
				<td>turi - we are</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>uri - you are</td>
				<td>muri - you are</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ari - he (she) is</td>
				<td>bari - they are</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>In the third person forms the prefix changes to agree with the class of the
		subject of that verb. Here are the forms for the classes studied thus far:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 20px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 100px"> </td>
				<td style="width: 70px">Sing.</td>
				<td>Plural</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Class1</td>
				<td style="width: 50px">ari</td>
				<td>bari</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Class2</td>
				<td>uri</td>
				<td>iri</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Class3</td>
				<td>iri</td>
				<td>ziri</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>These same prefixes are used for all verbs. Be sure you know them. From now 
			on the verb prefixes of each class will be introduced with that class.</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 20px">
			<tr>
				<td>e.g.</td>
				<td>Imana iravuga - God is speaking.</td>
			</tr> 
			<tr>
				<td> </td>
				<td>Impene ziragenda - the goats are going.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> </td>
				<td>Ufise imbuto - you have seeds.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>-ri is a defective verb, that is, it lacks certain parts. It has no infinitive 
			and only a few tenses. The missing forms are provided by the verb kuba -to be, 
			become, live (in a certain place). The verb -ri usually elides in writing as 
			well as in speaking. Thus, umwana ar'i muhira - the child is at home. Hari is a form of -ri.</p>
		<p>Note: Observe the sentence order when using hehe, always at the end of sentence or clause.</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 100px">
			<tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Impene</td>
				<td>zawe</td>
				<td>ziri</td>
				<td>hehe?</td>
				<td> </td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>goats</td>
				<td>your</td>
				<td>are</td>
				<td>where</td>
				<td>(Where are your goats?)</td>
			</tr>
