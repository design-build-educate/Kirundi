			<h4>Vocabulary</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>urupfu - death (no pl.)</li>
				<li>ubushobozi - power (no pl.)</li>
				<li>ubgami - kingdom (no pl.)</li>
				<li>guharira - to forgive</li>
				<li>kugwa - to fall</li>
				<li>gupfa - to die</li>
			</ul>

			<p>103. Personal pronouns. Though the personal pronoun as subject does not have to be expressed 
				other than by the personal prefixes (i.e. <u>n</u>dagenda - <u>n</u> is personal prefix). 
				these pronouns exist and are needed in many instances.</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>jewe</td>
					<td>I, me</td>
					<td>twebge</td>
					<td>we, us</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>wewe (we)</td>
					<td>you (s.)</td>
					<td>mwebge</td>
					<td>you (pl.)</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>we</td>
					<td>he, him, she, her</td>
					<td>bo</td>
					<td>they, them</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The <u>we</u> in parentheses after wewe is to indicate that sometimes this pronoun is simply <u>we</u> 
				instead of wewe. The third person singular <u>we</u> looks the same as the 2nd person, but in 
				pronunciation it is clipped off a bit shorter than the 2nd person. Get an African to say both sounds for you.</p>
			<aside>Caution: Do not try to use these words as objects of verbs. One would never say "Ndabona wewe" 
				for "I see you". You will soon learn how to say that correctly.</aside>
			<p>These pronouns may be used as subjects of verbs when emphasis is desired.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>e.g. Jewe nzoguma hano ariko wewe uzogenda - I shall stay here, but you will go.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>104. Muri and Kuri. The prepositions mu and ku change to muri and kuri before:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>proper names,</li>
				<li>all words beginning with consonants,</li>
				<li>the personal pronouns, and</li>
				<li>the demonstratives. (The demonstratives will be learned in a later lesson.)</li>
			</ol>
			<aside>
				<p>Exception: With certain names of places they remain mu and ku.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>e.g. ku Muyebe is the form always used for "at Muyebe".</li>
					<li>muri Yesu - in Jesus</li>
					<li>kuri twebge - unto us (or, to us)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note: mu or muri may mean "among". muri mwebge - among you</p>
