			<p>105. Ordinary past. All the tenses dealt with thus far were formed by changes in the prefix. 
				But the past tenses are formed by changing the suffix as well as the prefix. There are some 
				rules to go by for forming these suffixes, but since so many verbs are irregular in this respect, 
				the past stem will be given with all verbs from now on.</p>
			<p>Here are the past stems of a few verbs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>gukora - koze</li>
				<li>kugenda - giye</li>
				<li>kuvuga - vuze</li>
				<li>kuzana - zanye</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now note the conjugation:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>nakose</td>
					<td>I worked</td>
					<td>twakoze</td>
					<td>we worked</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>wakoze</td>
					<td>you worked</td>
					<td>mwakoze</td>
					<td>you worked</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>yakoze</td>
					<td>he, she worked</td>
					<td>bakoze</td>
					<td>they worked</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The rule for forming this tense is: personal prefix plus <u>a</u> (which is the tense sign), 
				and past stem of verb. n-a-koze</p>
			<aside>Note the contraction: u-a-koze becomes wakoze, a-a-koze becomes yakoze, 
				tu-a-koze becomes twakoze, etc.</aside>

			<p>106. The main use of this tense is to express that which has happened earlier in the same day. 
				It may also be used for that which happened at a previous time, but the tone is different.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Past today:
					<ul>
						<li>If nothing follows the verb:
							<table>
								<tr>
									<td>n&#257;koze</td>
									<td>tw&#257;koze</td>
									<td> </td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>w&#257;koze</td>
									<td>mw&#257;koze</td>
									<td>The -&#257;- must be a low tone.</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>y&#257;koze</td>
									<td>b&#257;koze</td>
									<td> </td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</li>
						<li>If something follows the verb: the singular takes short -a-, but it is a low tone 
							whether long or short:						
							<table>
								<tr>
									<td>nakoze ibikorwa</td>
									<td>But:</td>
									<td>tw&#257;koze ibikorwa</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>wakoze ibikorwa</td>
									<td></td>
									<td>mw&#257;koze ibikorwa</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>yakoze ibikorwa</td>
									<td></td>
									<td>b&#257;koze ibikorwa</td>
								</tr>
							</table>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Past before today:
					<p>The form is the same, but the tone is high (see Lesson 71).</p>
				</li>
