		<h3>LESSON 29: Future Tense</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary</p>
			<ul>
				<li>kubika - to put away</li>
				<li>kugaruka - to return, come back</li>
				<li>kugira - to do, make, have</li>
				<li>ubgoba - fear</li>
				<li>gusubira - to return, go back</li>
				<li>ejo - yesterday, tomorrow (depending on the tense of verb)</li>
				<li>uyu musi - today</li>
				<li>ku mugoroba - in the afternoon (about 3:00 till 6:00)</li>
			</ul>
		<p>57. Future tense. For future time after today the particle -z&#333;- is inserted in
			the verb between the personal prefix and the verb stem. This is often called 
			the far future tense. -z&#333;- is always long in both affirmative and negative.
			Thus:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 20px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 250px">nz&#333;genda - I shall go</td>
				<td>tuz&#333;genda - we shall go</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>uz&#333;genda -you will go</td>
				<td>muz&#333;genda - you will go</td> 
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>az&#333;genda - he Will go</td>
				<td>baz&#333;genda - they will go</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>But for future time today (called the near future tense) the -ra present is
			 used, thus:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>ndagenda uyu musi - I shall go today</li>
				<li>nzogenda ejo - I shall go tomorrow</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Note: This tense will retain the -ra even in dependent clauses but not 
			negative, contrary to the rule for its use in now present time. Also it is 
			used when followed by an object or phrase.</p>
		<p>58. Verb kugira. This is a very important verb for it is used in many idiomatic 
			expressions, e.g. kugira ubgoba -to have fear, be afraid. You remember, also., 
			that this is the verb which supplies the missing parts of -fise. Thus, for the 
			future of "to have" you must use kugira.</p>
		<p>59. The verb kugaruka is used in the sense of to return to the place where the 
			speaker is. e.g. A man at Gitega would say of another, "Azogaruka ino ejo" - he 
			will return here tomorrow. But if a man is at Gitega and says, "I will return 
			to Bujumbura tomorrow." he would not use kugaruka, but gusubira. e.g. 
			Nzosubira i Bujumbura ejo - I will return (go back) to Bujumbura tomorrow.</p>
