		<h3>LESSON 19: Class 5 (cont.): Continuous present</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary</p>
			<ul>
				<li>amazi - water</li>
				<li>amata - milk</li>
				<li>amavuta - butter, oil</li>
				<li>ameza - table (Sw.)</li>
				<li>amaraso - blood</li>
				<li>-gomba - want</li>
				<li>ico - dirt (not soil as in garden)</li>
				<li>icumu - spear</li>
			</ul>
		<p>33. There are a number of words in this class which have only the plural form. Of course, all agreements 
			are with this plural form. The first 6 words in this vocabulary are some of these. You will learn 
			others later.</p>
		<p>34. 5th class words having c. The last two words in this vocabulary: icumu and ico, look like 4th class 
			words with a vowel root. But they are regular 5th class words forming their plurals like any other word
			in the class: icumu - spear, amacumu - spears, (the stem is -cumu).</p> 
		<p>Besides the two words given here, there is one other of common use - icukiro - manure heap. There may be 
			a few other rare words beginning with ic- which belong to this class, but in general you may assume 
			that any other words beginning with ic- belong to 4th class.</p>
		<p>35. Another important present tense is conjugated as follows:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 10px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 300px">ndiko ndakora - I am working</td>
				<td>turiko turakora - we are working</td>
			</tr> 
			<tr>
				<td>urik' urakora - you are working</td>
				<td>muriko murakora - you are working</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>arikw arakora - he is working</td>
				<td>bariko barakora - they are working</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>This is the tense most cormnonly used for the continuous present: I am working, when the sense is 
			that right now I am in the act of working. You will see it is composed of the present of -ri + ko 
			followed by the -ra- present of the verb desired.</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 10px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 40px">e.g.</td>
				<td style="width: 250px">Umukozi ari hehe?</td>
				<td>Arikw ararima mu murima wanje.</td>
			</tr> 
			<tr>
				<td> </td>
				<td>Where is the workman?</td>
				<td>He is hoeing in my garden.</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Note: This tense is not subject to the rules applying to the -ra- present.</p>
		<p>The negative is formed like this:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 10px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 200px">sindiko ndakora</td>
				<td>ntituriko turakora</td>
			</tr> 
			<tr>
				<td>nturik' urakora</td>
				<td>ntimuriko murakora</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ntarikw arakora</td>
				<td>ntibariko barakora</td>
			</tr>
