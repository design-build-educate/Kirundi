			<p>66. There is only one word in Class 10: ahantu - place.
				However, this prefix ha- is used to express the idea 
				of place whether the word ahantu is used or not.</p>
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">
			<p>67. some uses of the ha- prefix</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In the adjective.					
					<ol>
						<li>to agree with the adverb of place. e.g. Hano ni heza - Here it is
								good. or, It is a good place here.</li>
						<li>in the adjective when ahantu is understood. e.g., Ni habi cane.
							 It is (a) very bad (place).</li>
					</ol>	
				</li>
				<li>As a verb subject.				
					<ol>
						<li>to agree with ahantu or adverb of place. e.g. Hariya hitwa Gitega.
							 That place over there is called Gitega.</li>
						<li>in an impersonal sense when no subject is expressed. e.g. Hara shushe - It is hot.</li>
						<li>to represent the English expletive "there". (You have already seen this 
							in hari.) e.g. Haza umugabo - there comes a man. Hariho ibijumbu? - are 
							there any sweet potatoes? (Actually, Harih' ibijumbu?)</li>
						<aside>Note: In "hariho" the final ho gives the idea of place also. 
							Note that in answering this question one would make the verb agree 
							with ibijumbu - Ego, biriho - yes, there are. Nta biriho - there are 
							none. (See par. 213.) Sometimes just "hari" is used. e.g. Har' amazi menshi hano. - 
							There is much water here.</aside>
					</ol>	
				</li>
				<li>In the expression "mu maso hiwe" - his face. Since there is no other 
					word for face, amaso is used with the possessive adjective having the 
					<u>ha</u> prefix, and it is preceded by <u>mu</u>.</li>
				<li>"In" is not usually used with <u>ahantu</u>: not "mu hantu heza", Thus. 
					"in a good place" is "ahantu heza".</li>
