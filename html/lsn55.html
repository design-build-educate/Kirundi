			<h3>LESSON 55: Negative of Ordinary Past</h3>	
		</header>
		<section class="vocab">
			<h4>Vocabulary</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>ikaramu - pencil (sing. may be 3rd or 5th, pl. is 5th)</li>
				<li>urukaratasi - paper (Sw.) (or, igi-karatasi)</li>
				<li>canke - or</li>
				<li>gukurikira (ye) - to follow</li>
				<li>ishengero - crowd, church (people)</li> 
				<li>kuva (-v&#363;ye) - to come from, come away from</li>
			</ul>						
		</section> <!-- end of vocab section -->
		<section class="parag">
			<p>112. The negative of the ordinary past is simply the negative prefix, personal prefix, tense sign 
				and past stem, thus:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<td>sinagiye</td>
					<td>I didn't go</td>
					<td>ntitwagiye</td>
					<td>we didn't go</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>ntiwagiye</td>
					<td>you didn't go</td>
					<td>ntimwagiye</td>
					<td>you didn't go</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>ntiyagiye</td>
					<td>he didn't go</td>
					<td>ntibagiye</td>
					<td>they didn't go</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<p>The same rule applies for vowel-stem verbs:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>sinogeje - I didn't wash</li>
				<li>ntibubatse - they didn't build</li>
			</ul>
			<p>With other classes: ntizagiye - they didn't go (cows)</p>

			<p>113. Remember that kuva is usually followed by mu or ku (par. 10), though it may not always be.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Wavuye hehe? Navuye mw ishuli. - Where did you come from? I came from school.</li>
