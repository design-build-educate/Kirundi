		<h3>LESSON 2:    Ni and Si</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary</p>
			<ul>
				<li>umw&#257;na (pl. ab&#257;na) - child</li>
				<li>umwami (abami) - king, Lord</li>
				<li>umw&#299;g&#299;sha (ab&#299;g&#299;sha) - teacher</li>
				<li>umw&#299;g&#299;shwa (ab&#299;g&#299;shwa) - pupil</li>
				<li>afise  - he has</li>
				<li>bafise - they have</li>
				<li>cane (adv.) - much, very</li>
				<li>urakoze - thank you</li>		
			</ul>
		<p>3. Vowel change. Though we observed that the singular prefix of Class 1 is 'umu', we will find some 
			words in which it seems to be 'umw', as in the nouns given above. This is due to the fact that u before 
			another vowel becomes w. This rule applies not only in this instance but wherever u precedes another 
			vowel. Thus: umu-ana becomes umw&#257;na. This lengthens the vowel which begins the stem, 
			umw&#299;gisha, ab&#299;gisha. Also, a before another vowel drops out, thus the plural of these nouns: aba-ana =abana; 
			aba-igisha = ab&#299;gisha. (later you will learn an exception to this rule about a.)</p>	
		<p>4. Use of Ni and Si. Ni means is or are, (3rd pers. sing. and pl., present), and does not  change its form regardless of the subject. Its negative is Si, meaning is not, are not. These words may not be used in a dependent clause or when followed by a word of place. The i of these words is elided when preceding a word which begins with a vowel, unless that word is a proper noun. Remember this concerning all elision. Ni and si may be translated with the subject "it". e.g. N'umwami - it is the king. These words are usually used for a state of being, not place.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Umwana n'umukobga - the child is a girl.</li>
				<li>Umugabo s'umwami - the man is not a king.</li>
				<li>Umwigisha ni Andereya - the teacher is Andrew.</li>
			</ul>
		<p>Exception: If the subject of "is" or "are" is a place, the words ni and si may be used even if followed by a word of place. e.g. Gitega ni kure - Gitega is far away.</p>
