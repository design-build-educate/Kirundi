		<h3>LESSON 25: Prefixless Present Tense</h3>
		<p>Vocabulary</p>
			<ul>
				<li>kugura - to buy, sell</li>
				<li>gusenga - to pray, worship</li>
				<li>kubona - to see</li>
				<li>k&#363;za - to come</li>
				<li>n'ingoga - quickly</li>
				<li>buhoro-buhoro - slowly, softly, so-so (sometimes this word is used 
					in the simple form "buhoro")</li>
			</ul>
		<p>44. Prefixless Present. This is another tense used to express present time. 
			It is not truly "prefixless", for the personal prefixes are used the same as 
			for the -ra present. But the -ra is omitted. Thus:</p>
		<table style="margin-left: 50px">
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 200px">nkora - I work</td>
				<td>dukora - we work</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ukora - you work</td>
				<td>mukora - you work</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>akora - he works</td>
				<td>bakora - they work</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>There is a wide diversity of opinion about the use of these two present tenses, 
			and it is difficult to outline definite rules for them, because occasionally 
			they are used more or less interchangeably. However, there are certain rules 
			which must be observed for their use. Listen carefully to the Barundi and try 
			to observe for yourself the use of these tenses. It is important to know and 
			use both of them. The negative is the same as that of the -ra present, par.28.</p>
		<p>45. A few rules:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><p>In asking or answering questions the prefixless present is usually used if 
				an object follows the verb, in referring to now-present time, not habitual 
				present. In some localities the -ra present may be used.</p>
				<p>Ukora iki? - What are you doing? Nteka ibijumbu. - I'm cooking sweet potatoes.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p>It is usually used to express that which is happening just now 
				when another word follows in the same clause, other than cane or ati, 
				except when the continuous present (arikw aragenda) is used.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Ngomba kugenda. - I want to go.</li>
					<li>Agomba amazi. - He wants water.</li>
					<li>Mfise igitabo - I have a book.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>It must be used for present time in dependent clauses, which we will 
				study later.</li>
		</ol>
