			<h3>LESSON 1: Class 1 umu-aba</h3>	
		</header>
		<section class="parag">	
			<p>1.	As we take up the study of Kirundi, we must first get a little picture of the structure 
						of the language. In Kirundi the verb is perhaps the most important part of speech because 
						it serves for several parts of speech. However, we will take that up later and first look at nouns. 
						The nouns are found in ten classes, each class having its own set of prefixes. The prefix of a noun 
						will determine the prefix of other words related to that noun.</p>
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">
			<p>2.	Class 1. In this class we find only nouns which are names of people (not necessarily proper nouns). 
						However, some nouns referring to people will be found in other classes.</p>
				<section class="vocab">
					<h4>Here are a few words of this class:</h4>				
					<ul>
						<li>umugabo - man (married), husband</li>
						<li>abagabo - men, husbands</li>
						<li>umugore - woman (married), wife</li>
						<li>abagore - women, wives</li>
						<li>umuhungu - boy, son</li>
						<li>abahungu - boys, sons</li>
						<li>umukobga - girl, daughter</li>
						<li>abakobga - girls, daughters</li>
					</ul>			
					<p>Observe that each of these words in the singular begins with 'umu'. That is the singular prefix. 
						The plural prefix is 'aba'. From now on when you meet a word of the first class you will be able 
						to form the plural.</p> 
					<h4>Some verbs to learn:</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>arakora - he is working, he works</li>
							<li>barakora - they are working, they work</li>
							<li>aragenda - he is going, he goes</li>
							<li>baragenda - they are going, walking</li>
							<li>ararima - he is hoeing, he hoes</li>
							<li>bararima - they are hoeing, they hoe</li>
						</ul> 
					<p>Thus, singular verb prefix is a-, plural verb prefix is ba-.</p>
					<p>Note: These verbs may stand alone with no noun or pronoun subject expressed when the antecedent is known.</p>
