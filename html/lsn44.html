			<p>94. Gusubira - to repeat an action. (This is the same as gusubira. meaning "to return".)
				This is usually followed by the infinitive:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Subira kwandika - write again</li>
				<li>Subira kuvuga - say again, repeat it</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When gusubira, meaning "to repeat" stands by itself, the i is lengthened, gusub&#299;ra. e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sinzosubira kwibagira - I won't forget again.</li>
				<li>Sinzosub&#299;ra - I won't (do it) again.</li>
			</ul>		
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">
			<p>95. Gusaba and kubaza. Though both of these words mean "to ask" they are not used 
				interchangeably Kubaza means to ask a question only.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>e.g. Genda kubaza umwigisha - go to ask the teacher.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>But gusaba is used to ask for something or to ask a favor. In this latter sense it 
				means to pray, when asking God for something; but prayer in the sense of worship
				 is gusenga.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ndasaba agatambara - I ask for a little cloth.</li>
				<li>Ndasaba umuntu kugenda i Gitega - I am asking for a person to go to Gitega.</li>
				<li>Aragenda gusaba umutama kuza ino - He is going to ask the old man to come here.</li>
