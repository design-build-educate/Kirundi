			<ul>
				<li>gutw&#275;nga (ze) - to laugh, laugh at</li>
				<li>gut&#257;ta (se ) - to complain, fuss at</li>
				<li>kubora (ze) - to rot, spoil (int.) (caus. - boza)</li>
				<li>inkoni - walking stick</li>
				<li>uburake - anger</li>

			<p>160. With causative verbs one is apt to have two objects, for in English two verbs are really involved: 
				"to cause to" and "to work" (as for example in gukoresha). These two objects may be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One a secondary subject and the other a true object. e.g.
					<ul>
						<li>gukundisha Petero Yohana - to cause Peter to love John.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Petero is really the object of "to cause to" and the subject of "to love"; thus it is a secondary
						subject; while Yohana is the true object.</p>
				</li>
				<li>The two objects may be one an instrument and the other the object. e.g.
					<ul>
						<li>gukebesha imbugita urutoke - to cut the finger with a knife.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Imbugita is the instrument with which the finger is cut.</p>	
				</li>
				<p>In both of these examples the true object comes last, with the secondary subject or the instrument 
					immediately following the verb. However, you will hear and see examples where the true object 
					comes first: e.g. 
					<ul>
						<li>ukundishe Imana umutima wawe wose - love God with all your heart.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>One cannot make a definite rule about this order for it may vary. Experience will teach you. 
						If the secondary subject involves a group of words it will come last.</p> 
				</p>
			</ol>

		<section class="parag">	
			<p>161. The two objects may both be pronouns in the verb. e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>bawumubohesheje - they tied him with it (a rope)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When it is thus, the secondary subject or the instrument comes first with the true object following.
				Except, the pronouns n - me, ku - you, and tu - us, always come second and only the context 
				can determine the meaning. e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>kumugukundisha - could be, to cause him to love you, or, to cause you to love him.</li>
			</ul>.
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">	
			<p>162. If one is a pronoun and the other is a noun, only the context can determine the meaning.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Umwigisha amukundisha umworo - could be, the teacher causes him to love the poor man, or 
					the teacher causes the poor man to love him.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In most instances the context will make it clear.</p>
