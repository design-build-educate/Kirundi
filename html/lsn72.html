			<h3>LESSON 72: Negative of Far Past</h3>	
		</header>
		<section class="vocab">
			<h4>Vocabulary</h4>				
			<ul>
				<li>impamba - food for a journey</li>
				<li>kwiruka (tse) - to run, run away</li>
				<li>kera - long ago, a long time ahead</li>
				<li>guhwera (reye) - to die</li>
				<li>gutabara (ye) - to go to assistance of, help</li>
				<li>guhera (ze) - to finish (int.), be all gone</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>

			<p>143. For the negative of the far past you must drop the -ra, but the tone remains the same.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sinagiye</li>
				<li>ntiwagiye, etc.</li>
			</ul>	
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->

			<p>144. Sentence order. You learned that when both an indirect object pronoun and a direct one come 
				in the same verb, the direct precedes the indirect. However, when both a direct and indirect object 
				follow the verb the indirect is first unless it is a long phrase, in which case if the direct object 
				is but one word it comes first.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Nahaye Petero igitabo - I gave Peter a book.</li>
				<li>Nahaye igitabo umwana wa Petero - I gave Peter's child a book</li>
			</ul>	
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">	
			<p>145. Hirya y'ejo. This is an idiom for "day before yesterday" or "day after tomorrow". e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Yagiye hirya y'ejo - he went day before yesterday.</li>
				<li>Azogenda hirya y'ejo - he will go day after tomorrow.</li>
			</ul>	
		</section>  <!-- end of paragraph section -->
		<section class="parag">	
			<p>146. The stative of gupfa and guhwera is often used when a person is not actually dead 
				but is very ill (sometimes when he is not even very ill).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Arahwereye - (lit.) he is dying (but actually, "he is very ill)</li>
			</ul>	
			<p>However when they say</p>
			<ul>
				<li>"yarahwereye" or</li>
				<li>"yahwereye"</li>
			</ul>
			<p>they usually mean that he is actually dead.</p>	
			<p>There is no difference between gupfa and guhwera, except that gupfa is sometimes used of things 
				that no longer function. e.g.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Umupira wapfuye - the tire is flat</li>
			</ul>
